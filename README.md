Description of the model:

The model simulates a population of individuals who cooperate to produce and divide a resource. The population is composed of strong and weak individuals. Individuals can choose who they want to cooperate with. We observe how the resources will be divided, and in particular how strong individuals will decide to share resources with weak individuals. The model is an evolutionary model: the offers individuals make are genetically encoded and the resources accumulated by each individual determine the number of offsprings they produce. In other word, the question we ask is: what is the offer that will maximize an individual's fitness in an environment where strong and weak individuals coexist and partner choice is possible?
